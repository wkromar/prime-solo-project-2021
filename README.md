# EDA Project
Due to the pandemic, it is imperative that people spend less time in enclosed busy places. Snackr is an App designed to keep track of a users selected items to reduce their time spent browsing shelves in grocery or convenience stores. Users can browse and favorite tasty items to help create a list of potential choices. This stops the user from slowing down their trip due to indecision. They know what they want coming intoo the store.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following software installed on your computer:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [PostrgeSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/)
- [Spoonacular API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api)

# Built With
    Javascript, React, Redux, Node, Express, HTML, and Passport

## Create database and table

Create a new database called `prime_app` and create a `user` table:
Check the `detabase.sql` file within the project for all SQL queries used.

```SQL
CREATE TABLE "user"(
"id" SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
"username" varchar(20) NOT NULL,
"password" varchar(8) NOT NULL,
"is_admin" varchar(5) DEFAULT ('false')
);
```

If you would like to name your database something else, you will need to change `prime_app` to the name of your new database name in `server/modules/pool.js`

## Development Setup Instructions

- Run `npm install`
- Create a `.env` file at the root of the project and paste this line into the file:
  ```
  SERVER_SESSION_SECRET=superDuperSecret
  SPOONTACULAR_API_KEY= WHATEVER THE API IS
  ```
  While you're in your new `.env` file, take the time to replace `superDuperSecret` with some long random string like `25POUbVtx6RKVNWszd9ERB9Bb6` to keep your application secure. Here's a site that can help you: [https://passwordsgenerator.net/](https://passwordsgenerator.net/). If you don't do this step, create a secret with less than eight characters, or leave it as `superDuperSecret`, you will get a warning.
- Start postgres if not running already by using `brew services start postgresql`
- Run `npm run server`
- Run `npm run client`
- Navigate to `localhost:3000`

  Make an account using the Spoonacular API listed above. You will be given an API key. KEEP THIS SECRET. It is only for the person who deploys the app. Sharing it could comprimise security. There is a limited ammount of times you can call the APi for free. Upon reaching this limit, you will not be able to call anymore until the APi restarts 
the next morning.

## Production Build

Before pushing to Heroku, run `npm run build` in terminal. This will create a build folder that contains the code Heroku will be pointed at. You can test this build by typing `npm start`. Keep in mind that `npm start` will let you preview the production build but will **not** auto update.

- Start postgres if not running already by using `brew services start postgresql`
- Run `npm start`
- Navigate to `localhost:5000`

## Lay of the Land

Directory Structure:

- `src/` contains the React application
- `public/` contains static assets for the client-side
- `build/` after you build the project, contains the transpiled code from `src/` and `public/` that will be viewed on the production site
- `server/` contains the Express App

This code is also heavily commented. We recommend reading through the comments, getting a lay of the land, and becoming comfortable with how the code works before you start making too many changes. If you're wondering where to start, consider reading through component file comments in the following order:

- src/components
  - App/App
  - Footer/Footer
  - Nav/Nav
  - AboutPage/AboutPage
  - InfoPage/InfoPage
  - UserPage/UserPage
  - LoginPage/LoginPage
  - RegisterPage/RegisterPage
  - LogOutButton/LogOutButton
  - ProtectedRoute/ProtectedRoute

## Deployment

## Production Build


1. Sign up for an account on [Heroku.com](https://www.heroku.com/)
2. Install Heroku CLI by typing `brew tap heroku/brew && brew install heroku` in Terminal

- [Additional installation notes and troubleshooting](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#download-and-install)

> Note: Your project also needs to have a git repository.

Run the following commands from within your project folder.

1. Authenticate by typing `heroku login` in Terminal
2. In terminal, navigate to your project folder and type `heroku create`
3. Type `git remote -v` to ensure it added successfully
4. In terminal, type `git push heroku main`
5. You will need to add a MONGO_URI to your config env on heroku.
